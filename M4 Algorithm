%THIS ALGORITHM IS FOR THE ACTUAL KINETIC ENZYME TEST DATA. WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THE OUTLIERS IN THE ORIGINAL DATA

function [v_naught, vMax, Km, SSE] = M4_Algorithm_014_24(data)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ENGR 132
% Program Description
% The purpose of this function is to determine the initial velocities of
% each concentration of the different substrates. It is also to return the
% paramaters of vMax and Km for each enzyme.
%
% Function Call
% M2_Algorithm_014_24(data)
%
% Input Arguments
% data - The data that contains the information needed on the different
% substrates
%
% Output Arguments
% v_naught - The array that will be returned with each initial velocity for
% each concentration of substrate (m/s)
%
% vMax - The array that will be returned with each vMax for each enzyme
% (m/s)
%
% Km - The array that will be returned with each Km for each enzyme ([S] (uM))

%% CALCULATIONS
%All of these statements will fill an array of vnaughts respective to their
%concentrations. A simple moving average (SMA) is used to try and smooth
%the noisy data as much as possible. An average of the test data and the
%replicate test data is then taken and the initial slope of that data
%(calculated within the first 33 seconds) is found. That value is placed
%into the vnaught array. This is repeated for each concentration to add up
%to a total of 50 vnaughts.
for ct = 1:50
    j = 1; %SMA index counter
    data_y = data(3:end, col); %Test data ([P] (uM))
    data_yrep = data(3:end, col + 10); %Replicate test data ([P] (uM))
    %SMA = zeros([1, 7482]) Removed because of hardcoding
    %SMAyrep = zeros([1, 7482]) Removed because of hardcoding
    SMA = zeros([1, num_rows]); %Pre-allocates an array of zeros for use (improvement 2)
    SMAyrep = zeros([1, num_rows]); %Pre-allocates an array of zeros for use (improvement 2)
    col = col + 1;
    %These statements smooth both the original test data and the replicate
    %test data
    for i = 3:numel(data_y)
        for k = 2:-1:0
            SMA(j) = SMA(j) + (data_y(i - k));
            SMAyrep(j) = SMAyrep(j) + (data_yrep(i - k));
        end
        %The following two statements were removed because we decided it was best to get the average over 3 points instead of 2
        %SMA(j) = SMA(j) / 2; 
        %SMAyrep(j) = SMAyrep(j) / 2;
        SMA(j) = SMA(j) / 3; %improvement 3
        SMAyrep(j) = SMAyrep(j) / 3; %improvement 3
        j = j + 1;
    end
    data_SMAave = (SMA(1:end) + SMAyrep(1:end)) / 2; %Takes the average of the original and replicate test data in their smoothed form
    %coeffs = polyfit(data_x(2:20), data_SMAave(1:19), 1); Removed because 20 seconds was clearly not enough time to gather an accurate v_naught value.
    coeffs = polyfit(data_x(2:33), data_SMAave(1:32), 1); %Finds the slope of that averaged data within the first 33 seconds (improvement 3) 48 Seconds was chosen because it reflected the most accurate values based on the PGO data
    v_naught(Vrow, Vcol) = coeffs(1); %Places that value into the array as needed
    Vcol = Vcol + 1;
    if Vcol == 11
        Vcol = 1;
        Vrow = Vrow + 1;
    end
    %If the column index reaches the highest substrate concentration, it
    %will jump over the replicate test data to get to the next enzyme that
    %needs to be analyzed
    if col == 11
        col = 21;
    end
    if col == 31
        col = 41;
    end
    if col == 51
        col = 61;
    end
    if col == 71
        col = 81;
    end
end

%vMax = max(v_naught, [], 2); Removed because this method was terribly wrong

%These statements use the Lineweaver-Burk method (double reciprocals) to
%try and find Km and vMax values for each enzyme (improvement 1)

    Km(ct) = m_LineWeave(1) * vMax(ct);
    michaelis_menten(ct, :) = vMax(ct) * Sub_Concentrations ./ (Km(ct) + Sub_Concentrations); %This statement calculates the Michaelis-Menten values
